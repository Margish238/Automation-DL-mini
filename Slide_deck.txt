My project is about detecting object and providing brief-inforamation about it.
I found that whenever we see a new thing in our daily life we wonder what is that thing!.
we dont have any information about that,and the basic requirment to get information of that is name,
As the things are new to us,we even dont know the name of that thing.
So my project makes things easier to search any object.
Anyone can take photo of what they see.
Uploading that photo will guide user to more detailed inforamtion of it.

I faced a challenge in displaying two functions button in proper manner according to UX.
I researched about how to solve it and after many try and error I came this UI which almost good.

I integrated the image detection and automation part of the Workshop.
